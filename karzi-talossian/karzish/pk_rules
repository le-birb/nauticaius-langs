# pretty early on was a palatalization triggered by /i/
# everything but /h/ was affected
# also somewhere was unconditional deletion of initial consonants

# a bunch of stuff mutated based on palatalization
# don't remember exactly what went where, but I do remember /ç/ was involved somewhere
# I think it was xʲ > ç
# while ʃʲ ʒʲ tʃʲ dʒʲ → ɕ ʑ tɕ dʑ
# θʲ ðʲ > f v  happened also

# at some point, Nt Nd → tː dː (and likewise for other plosives)
# however Nd (and at this point, bare t) almost never happened so the few instances merged
# t → d → t
# dː → tː
# (again, likewise for other plosives)

# also x → h in unstressed syllables
# then h → ∅
# someting else went to /x/ I think
# then x → χ at some point under some circumstances

# vowels did some funky fresh things
# V → ə / -stress
# or similar
# then ə → V0 / _(C...)V0
# this recursed I believe
# so, e.g., ərəʑi → iriʑi
