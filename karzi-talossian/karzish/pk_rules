% pretty early on was a palatalization triggered by /i/
% everything but /h/ was affected
% also somewhere was unconditional deletion of initial consonants

% a bunch of stuff mutated based on palatalization
% don't remember exactly what went where, but I do remember /ç/ was involved somewhere
% I think it was xʲ > ç
% while ʃʲ ʒʲ tʃʲ dʒʲ → ɕ ʑ tɕ dʑ
% θʲ ðʲ > f v  happened also

% at some point, Nt Nd → tː dː (and likewise for other plosives)
% however Nd (and at this point, bare t) almost never happened so the few instances merged
% t → d → t
% dː → tː
% (again, likewise for other plosives)

% also x → h in unstressed syllables
% then h → ∅
% someting else went to /x/ I think
% then x → χ at some point under some circumstances

% vowels did some funky fresh things
% V → ə / -stress
% or similar
% then ə → V0 / _(C...)V0
% this recursed I believe
% so, e.g., ərəʑi → iriʑi
