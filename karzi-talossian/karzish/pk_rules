% somewhere in here some vowels got deleted and stuff

% one of the first differences between pt and pk is affricate voicing
A > E / V_V

% /i/ and /a/ cause some vowel raising and lowering, respectively
% gonna need to figure out the order they happened

i > e / _C*'?a
o > ɔ / _C*'?a
u > o / _C*'?a

ɛ > e / _C*'?i
a > ɛ / _C*'?i
o > u / _C*'?i

% pretty early on was a palatalization triggered by /i/
% also somewhere was unconditional deletion of initial consonants

C / / #_

/ ʲ / C_'?i

% at some point, Nt Nd → tː dː (and likewise for other plosives)
% however Nd (and at this point, bare t) almost never happened so the few instances merged
% t → d
% dː → tː
% (again, likewise for other plosives)

S > Sː / N_
N > ∅ / _S

% a bunch of stuff mutated based on palatalization
% don't remember exactly what went where, but I do remember /ç/ was involved somewhere
% I think it was xʲ > ç
% while ʃʲ ʒʲ tʃʲ dʒʲ → ɕ ʑ tɕ dʑ
% θʲ ðʲ > f v  happened also

xʲ > ç
ɣʲ > ʝ
θʲ > f
ðʲ > v
tːʲ > tːʃ
dʲ > dʒ
sʲ > ʃ
zʲ > ʒ
ʃʲ > ɕ
ʒʲ > ʑ
kːʲ > cː
gʲ > ɟ
lʲ > ʎ
hʲ > h
nʲ > ɲ
mʲ > m
pːʲ > pː
bʲ > b


% also x → h in unstressed syllables
% then h → ∅
% someting else went to /x/ I think
% then x → χ at some point under some circumstances

x > h / _[^']
x > χ
h > x / _'

h > ∅

% vowels did some funky fresh things
% V → ə / -stress
% or similar
% then ə → V0 / _(C...)V0
% this *not* recursed

V > ə / [^']_

' > ∅

ə > i / _C*i
ə > e / _C*e
ə > ɛ / _C*ɛ
ə > u / _C*u
ə > o / _C*o
ə > ɔ / _C*ɔ
ə > a / _C*a

% it's more complicated than this
% ə > ∅

ə > ∅ / _#

ʎ > l / _#
ʎ > j
cː > ç
ɟ > ʝ
ç > ɕ
ʝ > ʑ

% plosive rearrange to primary length contrast

[td] / ː / [td]_
[pb] / ː / [pb]_
[kg] / ː / [kg]_

T > D / _[^ː]
Dː > Tː
